# Deep Learning Model Deployment with FastAPI and Docker

This project demonstrates how to deploy a deep learning model trained on Geospatial Dataset using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for serving predictions, encapsulated within a Docker container for portability and ease of deployment.

## Features

- **FastAPI** offers a fast and easy-to-use API for serving model predictions.
- **Docker** ensures the model and dependencies are packaged for reproducible and scalable deployment.
- **Scalable**: Easily deployable on local machines, cloud platforms, or Kubernetes clusters.

## Requirements

You only need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your system. All other dependencies, including Python packages, are included in the Docker image.
